      <h2 class="sectionTitle">About Our Services</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Our services show the full picture, not just paint on a wall. We handle residential and commercial painting, plus carpentry support where needed. That matters because many painting problems start with the surface underneath. When trim is damaged, joints are open, or water has weakened wood, the best paint in the world will not hold up without the right repair work.
      </p>
      <p class="lead" style="margin-top:10px;">
        We also understand that homes and businesses have different needs. A family home may need calm colors, low odor planning, and careful protection of furniture and floors. A business may need quick scheduling, clean proof of progress, and coatings that resist scuffs in busy areas. Our service range is built to support both, while keeping the process clear and manageable.

          <h3>Home Interior and Exterior Painting</h3>
          <p>
            Interior and exterior painting for a home is not just about color. It is about comfort, protection, and how the space feels every day. On interior projects, we focus on clean lines, even coverage, and a finish that looks smooth in both daylight and indoor lighting. That means proper patching, sanding, and spot priming, plus careful work around corners, doors, and baseboards. A common real life issue is that walls look fine at night but show roller marks in the morning sun. Good technique and correct paint choice help prevent that.
          </p>
          <p>
            On exterior projects, the goal is both beauty and protection. Sun, moisture, and changing temperatures can wear down surfaces fast. We pay close attention to prep work because prep is what controls how long the paint will last. That can include scraping loose paint, caulking small gaps, and choosing coatings that match the surface. Another real life example is old trim that holds moisture, which can cause paint to bubble. Addressing that early helps avoid repeat costs later.
          </p>

        <div class="serviceCard">
          <h3>Commercial Interior and Exterior Painting</h3>
          <p>
            Commercial painting is about maintaining a professional look while keeping the space functional. Most businesses cannot shut down for long confirming; they need a clear schedule and a clean work zone. We plan projects in a way that supports daily operations, whether that means working after hours, focusing on sections at a time, or using fast cure systems where appropriate. A good commercial paint job should not just look fresh, it should also be easy to clean and hard to damage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inside a business, paint affects the experience of customers and staff. Clean walls and trim can make a space feel brighter, more organized, and more welcoming. In high traffic areas, scuffs and marks are common, so choosing the right finish matters. Outside, the building exterior is your first impression. Faded paint or peeling surfaces can make a place look older than it is. Proper prep and weather aware scheduling helps avoid early failure.
          </p>

        <div class="serviceCard">
          <h3>Cabinet Painting</h3>
          <p>
            Cabinet painting is one of the fastest ways to change the feel of a kitchen or bathroom without replacing everything. Many homeowners think cabinets just need paint, but the truth is the prep is more important than the color. Cabinets are touched every day. Oils from hands, cooking residue, and cleaning products can weaken the bond of paint if the surface is not cleaned and prepped correctly. Our process is built around clean prep, correct primer selection, and finishes that resist chipping and staining.
          </p>
          <p>
            A real life example: some cabinets look smooth after one coat, but the finish can start to scratch if the paint system is wrong for the material. Wood, laminate, and MDF surfaces can behave differently. Hardware removal, labeling, and careful reinstallation helps keep everything aligned, so doors close right and drawers slide well. The goal is a finish that looks factory clean, not thick or uneven.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your cabinets look dated but the structure is still strong, this service can be a smart upgrade: <a href="https://socalhousepainting.com/cabinet-painting/">cabinet painting</a>.

        <div class="serviceCard">
          <h3>Lead Abatement</h3>
          <p>
            Lead abatement is a safety focused service for properties that may contain lead based paint. This is most common in older buildings. The risk is not just paint on the wall, it is what happens when that paint is disturbed through sanding, scraping, or renovation. Dust can spread fast and can be harmful, especially for children and pregnant individuals. That is why lead work needs a careful process, clear containment, and safe cleanup practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            A simple real life scenario is a homeowner who wants to repaint older trim. If the trim has old paint layers, normal sanding can create dust that moves into nearby rooms. A safe plan includes containment, protective equipment, and proper disposal methods. It is also important to keep the site clean and organized during work, not just at the end. The goal is to reduce risk and support a healthier indoor environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you think a property may have lead paint and you want safe handling, review this service: <a href="https://socalhousepainting.com/lead-abatement/">lead abatement</a>.

          <h3>Residential Carpentry</h3>
          <p>
            Residential carpentry supports strong paint results by fixing what paint cannot fix on its own. If trim is cracked, wood has rot, or joints are opening, paint will not hide the problem for long. Carpentry gives you clean edges, stable surfaces, and better finishing lines. It can include baseboard repair, trim replacement, small framing fixes, and other detail work that prepares a home for a polished final look.

          <p>
            A real life example is around windows and doors. When trim is uneven, the paint line will always look messy, even if the color is perfect. When the trim is repaired and aligned, the finished paint looks sharper and more professional. Carpentry can also help with small gaps that let in drafts or moisture, which protects the home and can reduce future damage.

          <h3>Commercial Carpentry</h3>
          <p>
            Commercial carpentry is focused on durability, safety, and clean presentation. Businesses often deal with daily wear from customers, carts, equipment, and frequent cleaning. Trim can get damaged, corners can take hits, and surfaces can weaken over time. When these issues are fixed correctly, the space looks better and also works better. This service supports build outs, repairs, and finishing work that helps a business stay polished and functional.
          </p>
          <p>
            One common real life situation is a retail space where baseboards are constantly scuffed or damaged. Replacing or repairing them gives the walls a cleaner edge and makes repainting much more effective. Another example is office upgrades where small carpentry changes improve how a room feels, such as cleaner framing details or repaired door casings. Strong carpentry creates a solid base for a clean paint finish.
